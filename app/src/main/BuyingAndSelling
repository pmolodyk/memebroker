The price of every meme is calculated from the number of shares that were sold. You can buy any amount of shares of any meme, but every share is more expensive than the previous one. To buy shares of a meme, just tap the image, then choose "Buy" and set the amount of shares you want to purchase. [IMAGE HERE]. All memes you own will apear in your "Assets" tab. To sell memes, tap them from your assets list, choose "Sell" and set the amount of shares you want to sell. You can also add any meme to your shortlist if you want to analyze how the share cost changes by long-pressing the image and then choosing "add to shortlist". You can access your shortlist from the menu. The meme tabs in the shortlist show the current price of one share and how much a share cost when you added this meme. You can long-tap the meme to update the price.
