Uploading your own memes.

Any user can upload his own meme to MemeBroker. You can do this by pressing the "Upload" button in the lower right corner. [IMAGE HERE]
You will be prompted to choose an image from your storage. After you have chosen the image a smaller copy of it will appear on your screen. Make sure it is uploaded in the correct orientation and rotate it using the "rotate" button otherwise. [IMAGE HERE]. Please note that all images will be scaled to reduce data traffic. Also note that adult content is strictly prohibited, as well as any illegal or abusive content. All users that upload inappropriate images will be banned. Refer to our Terms of Service for more details. If you see a meme that seems inappropriate, long-press the image and choos the "report" option. All reported images will be reviewed, and if the image is confirmed as abusive, all users that reported the image will recieve bonus respect points. Only use image reporting if necessary, if you report an image that does not include abusive content, your respect will be lowered, and if you lose too much respect points, you will be banned!
